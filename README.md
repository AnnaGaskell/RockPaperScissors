# RockPaperScissors

This is my first major Javascript project. It is based on the ODIN Project parameters and is open-ended in terms of styling and execution
    
    
# Introduction

One: 
    A console based game that a user plays against a computer. 
    This includes a function for a single round and a second function repeats this round until a winner is declared.



Two:
    A UI based game that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript with DOM manipulation.

# Summary

This partciular part of the project was not inherently challenging. It utilized functions and conditions for a well known game. My struggle was mainly in layout and proper equations.
    
Since this was my first project, writing out all of this code was strange for me and at times I had diffculty picturing whether or not it made sense. I went through many console.log sequences and a lot of minor changes until it made sense. 
    
I enjoyed this part of the project and was thrilled when a result came through.
